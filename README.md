# Daylight

Daylight is a watchOS (only) app that runs on your watch and helps you through the long winter nights by showing motivational data about the day length.

This currently is a very MVP and only really works well in the time between winter and summer solstice. For the other time it's actually baing the opposite of motivational. 

I will take care of this by offering a very different UI as the days grow shorter, but at this time I'm not quite sure what I want to display.

In general: This app is written mostly for myself and thus is *very* opionated. The purpose of this app is to help *me* though the long winter nights. Nothing else.

As such, if you do file an issue or even a pull request, be prepared for it to not be handled because any and all changes to this app will be done in spirit of helping me through winter. If it doesn't immediately benefit my personal motication, I will not add it to the app.
