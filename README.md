# Daylight

Daylight is a watchOS (only) app that runs on my watch and helps me through the long winter nights by showing motivational data about the day length.

This currently is a very MVP and only really works well in the time between winter and summer solstice (and only on the northern hemisphere). For the other half year the current UI is actually the opposite of motivational.

I will take care of this by offering a very different UI as the days grow shorter, but at this time I'm not quite sure what I want to display.

In general: This app is written mostly for myself and thus is *very* opinionated. The purpose of this app is to help *me* though the long winter nights. Nothing else.

As such, if you do file an issue or even a pull request, be prepared for it to not be handled because any and all changes to this app will be done in spirit of helping me through winter. If it doesn't immediately benefit my personal motivation, I will not add it to the app.

Known issues:

* probably unexpected results around the DST switch
* doesn't deal well with the southern hemisphere
* super minimal feature set
